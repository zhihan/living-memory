This is a specific website for all the saints in the Lord's recovery who are burdened to participate in preaching the gospel and spreading the high truths throughout the US. In these days of widespread spiritual hunger, there will be many opportunities for the saints to rise up and proclaim God’s Word, personally and in small groups in their daily life as well as participating in larger distribution events across the country.
