# Agent-Static-CMS

A static website generated and managed by an AI agent based on its memory.

## Core Idea
- Agent as the content manager and site generator.
- Users choose templates to define the 'personality' and 'layout' of the generated site.
- Updates are triggered by changes in agent memory.
